### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
-search for players and return results
-display stats for individual players

#### PostMVP 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Add second API
-add a live NBA scoreboard with up to date stats with most recent data.(scores from previous night)

|Jan 2rd| Missed Class
|Jan 3rd| Approval/Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Incomplete
|Jan 5th| Styling(Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Jan 6th| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Styling overall page | H | 5 hrs | -- | -- |
| Adding Submit button and form adding the events and return data | H | 3hrs| -- | -- |
| Coding | H | 8hrs | -- | -- |`
| Working with API | H | 8hrs| 4hrs | -- | -- |
| adding and removing search subjects | M | 2hrs | -- | -- |
| stacking stats over one another | H | 5hrs | 
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
